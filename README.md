# Motivation

There is no existing data or tools to predict apartment pricing in Latin America. In this repo I developed a data scraper to get add post for new apartements in Panama city. This project will later scalate to include other countries in the region as well as including transportation network.

## Objective
Assess the house pricing behavior in the Latin American Region to contribute in the developement of housing policy for the benefit of communities considering:
- Price
- Area
- Age
- Movility 
- Accesibility 
- Equity
- Inclusion
