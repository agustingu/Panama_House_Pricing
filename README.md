# Motivation

There is no existing data or tools to predict apartment pricing in Latin America which makes the development of housing policies very challenging. In this repository I developed a data scraper to get apartment pricing information in Panama city (area, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, parkings, location). This project will later scalate to include other countries in the region as well as including transportation network.

## Objective
Assess the house pricing behavior in the Latin American Region to contribute in the developement of housing policy for the benefit of communities considering:
- Price
- Area
- Age
- Movility 
- Accesibility 
- Equity
- Inclusion

## Current Products:
- Panama Add Data Scraper: Uses a webdriver to extract apartements on sale in Panama City and export data to .CSV file.
- Data Preprosessing: Handles outliers, missing data, data scallling, normalization, etc

### Machine Learning algorithms evaluation
- Regression
- Random Forest
- ANN
## Next Steps:
Get transportation network data and match it with apartments locations.
