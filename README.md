# Motivation

There is no existing data or tools to predict apartment pricing in Latin America which makes the development of housing policies very challenging. In this repository I developed a data scraper to get apartment pricing information in Panama city (area, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, parkings, location). This project will later scalate to include other countries in the region as well as including transportation network.

## Objective
Assess the house pricing behavior in the Latin American Region to contribute in the developement of housing policy for the benefit of communities considering:
- Price
- Area
- Age
- Movility 
- Accesibility 
- Equity
- Inclusion
## Currently Working on...:
Get transportation network data and match it with apartments locations.
